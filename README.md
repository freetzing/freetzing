# Freetzing

The focus of this project is to construct a version of Fritzing that is highly modularized and exposed to a wider array of the open source community.

## Development

We are currently working on the [`fritzing-js`](https://github.com/freetzing/fritzing-js) library to provide a bridge between **freetzing** and the **Fritzing** ecosystem. Check back again soon, as we will immediately focus development on this repository once the library has been completed.
